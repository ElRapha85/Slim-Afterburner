# Slim-Afterburner
My slimfit version of the Afterburner with 5015 fan  
- great cooling with sunon 5015 fan 
- less front-heavy 
- better view on the nozzle  
- 40gr. lighter 
- not quite finished yet
- for Dragon Hotend
- 5015 fan needs to be cut to fit
- 5015 frontcover is a remix of Greg191134's 5015_mount_front - Sunon 5015 fan.stl
